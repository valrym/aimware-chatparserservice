# ChatParserService
Parsing chat services since 16/5/19.

# How to use?
For aimware console commands, type the aimware prefix followed by any command and its respective variable.

For instance, type "[aimware prefix] rbot_antiaim_enable 0" to disable antiaim.

For console commands, type the console prefix followed by any command and again its respective variable.

For example, type "[console prefix] echo hey" will result in the console echoing "hey".

This is just a proof of concept, but can be built upon for custom command parsing very easily.

Thanks for reading, 
app.
